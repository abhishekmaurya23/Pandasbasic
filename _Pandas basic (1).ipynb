    "In Pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure that consists of rows and columns. It can be thought of as a collection of Pandas Series, where each column represents a Series. The DataFrame provides powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between a DataFrame and a Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dimensionality: A Series is a one-dimensional data structure that represents a single column of data with associated labels (index). In contrast, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional structure with both rows and columns, allowing for the representation of multiple variables or features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structure: A Series contains only a single column of data, while a DataFrame can have multiple columns, each potentially of a different data type. DataFrame columns can be heterogeneous and can hold different types of data (numeric, string, datetime, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functionality: DataFrames provide additional functionality compared to Series due to their two-dimensional nature. DataFrames allow for indexing and selection of rows and columns, merging and joining multiple DataFrames, grouping and aggregating data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Storage: A Series stores data in a one-dimensional array with an associated index, whereas a DataFrame stores data in a tabular format, where each column can be considered as a Series. DataFrames are more suitable for storing and organizing structured data, such as data from a CSV file or a database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between a Series and a DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Series\n",
    "series = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], name='Numbers')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a DataFrame\n",
    "data = {'Name': ['John', 'Emily', 'Mark', 'Jane', 'Alice'],\n",
    "        'Age': [25, 32, 28, 41, 36],\n",
    "        'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney']}\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",

    "print(df)\n",

    "2  Mark  28      Paris\n",
    "3  Jane  41      Tokyo\n",
    "4  Alice  36     Sydney\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a Series called `series` with numerical values. It represents a single column of data with associated labels. The DataFrame `df` is created from a dictionary of lists, where each key-value pair corresponds to a column of data. The DataFrame has three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'City', each representing a different variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print(series)` statement displays the Series with its index and values. The `print(df)` statement displays the DataFrame with its column names and associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, a Series is a one-dimensional labeled array, whereas a DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure with rows and columns, consisting of multiple Series. DataFrames are more suitable for handling structured, tabular data, while Series are often used for representing a single column or data series within a DataFrame."

    "Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Here are some common functions you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`head()` and `tail()`**: These functions allow you to retrieve the first few rows (`head()`) or the last few rows (`tail()`) of a DataFrame. They are useful for quickly inspecting the structure and content of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`shape()`**: The `shape()` function returns the dimensions of the DataFrame, i.e., the number of rows and columns. It is helpful for understanding the size of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`describe()`**: The `describe()` function provides summary statistics of numerical columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. It gives a quick overview of the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`info()`**: The `info()` function provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including column names, data types, and the count of non-null values in each column. It helps in understanding the data types and identifying missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`unique()`**: The `unique()` function returns the unique values in a column of the DataFrame. It is useful for identifying distinct categories or checking for unique identifiers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`value_counts()`**: The `value_counts()` function counts the occurrences of each unique value in a column. It is commonly used to understand the frequency distribution of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`sort_values()`**: The `sort_values()` function sorts the DataFrame based on one or more columns. It allows you to arrange the data in ascending or descending order, which is helpful for ranking, finding top values, or ordering categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **`groupby()`**: The `groupby()` function groups the data based on one or more columns. It allows you to perform aggregate operations on groups of data, such as calculating sums, means, counts, or applying custom functions, and obtain insights from grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **`fillna()`**: The `fillna()` function replaces missing values in the DataFrame with specified values or methods. It helps in handling missing data by imputing or filling in the gaps with appropriate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **`apply()`**: The `apply()` function applies a function to one or more columns or rows of a DataFrame. It enables you to perform custom transformations or computations on the data, such as applying mathematical functions, data cleaning operations, or user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a DataFrame named `sales_data` with columns like 'Product', 'Price', and 'Quantity'. You want to calculate the total revenue for each product by multiplying the 'Price' and 'Quantity' columns. You can use the `apply()` function to achieve this:\n",

    "\n",
    "def calculate_revenue(row):\n",
    "    return row['Price'] * row['Quantity']\n",

    "Output:\n",

    "4       B     12         3       36\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `calculate_revenue` function is defined to multiply the 'Price' and 'Quantity' columns of each row.
